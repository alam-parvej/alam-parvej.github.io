Dr. Alam is an accomplished researcher passionate about pushing the boundaries of knowledge. He is an independent project leader and assistant professor (adjunct) at the School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Shenzhen. He has been selected for National High-level Young Scholar Program (overseas).

Dr. Alam obtained his Ph.D. from BITS Pilani, India (2011-2016). Then, he moved to The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2016 for postdoctoral research and joined Prof. Ben Zhong Tang's group. In 2023, he joined the Clinical Translational Research Center of Aggregation-Induced Emission, School of Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Science and Engineering, CUHK, Shenzhen, and started working as an independent PI. 
His current research interests include the development of Near Infra-red (NIR) emissive organic long-persistent luminescent, room temperature phosphorescent, and Aggregation-induced emissive (AIE) materials and their applications in biomedical imaging, biological image-guided therapy, photodynamic therapy, and drug delivery.
Dr. Alam significantly contributed to the field throughout his doctoral and postdoctoral journey, publishing several groundbreaking papers in renowned journals. So far, Prof. Alam has published over 41 SCI papers, including 23 SCI papers published by the first author / corresponding author in top journals, such as JACS, Adv. Mater., Adv. Funct. Mater., Nat. Commun., Angew. Chem., ACS Nano, Small, etc., with 14 papers' impact factor greater than 14. The total citations are over 1800 times, and the H index is 27.
